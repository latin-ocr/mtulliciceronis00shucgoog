the retreshment oi the cold bath; but swimming in the open
bath or pond may be leit to the young. Oursus refers to the

kind ol dice used in playing olco, representing the Greek

iaces 1 and 6, and 3 and 4, the other two being somewhat curved,
and four were used in playing. Tesserae were like our modern
dice, and three were employed in a game. See Becker's Gallus,
p. 499, and Smith’s Dict. of Antip. It was a game entirely ot
chance, ct. Quid cmm sors est? idem prope modam, quod

conjectured ut, in which he had been anticipated by Henry
Allen (Dublin, 1852), who is followed by G. Long. It appears
also to be the reading ot more than one Ms.) Se. saciant.
