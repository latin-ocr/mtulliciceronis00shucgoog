and had to work in a mill ior hie living, and wrote and sold his
plays to the aediles in the intervals ot his work. There are
twenty of his plays in existence, which are all (except one, Vid-
alama, now lost) that Cicero’s contemporary Varro allowed to
be genuine, though at one time as many as 130 were attributed
to him (Aulus Gell. 3, 3). Like those oi the other comio writers
before and after him at Rome, his plays were translated or

adapted from the Greek oi the authors oi the New Comedy at κ

Athens„ Menander, Diphilus, and Philemon; or sometimes,
according to Horace (Ep. 2,1, 58), from the writers of the Old
Comedy, such as Epicharmus. Varro said oi him, ‘The musas
if they spoke Latin would use the language of Plautus’ (Quint.
10, 1, 99). See Hor, Are P. 270.

praenomen was Morcus or Lucius) was a native of Tarentum ³

born about the year ac. 283. When Tarentum was captured
in 275, he was brought as a slave to Rome, but afterwards
set free by some Livius (perhaps M. Livius Salinator), and took
as usual the name oi hispatronus. Tarentum was a Greek town,
and Livius found means of supporting himself at Rome by
tecching Greek. He published a translation of the Odyssea in
the Saturnian metro, which Cicero (Brut. §ili declares to be
unworthy oi a second reading; and also is said to have been the
first to weave the rude Seterrae or medley songs into the form oi
a play. He afterwards translated Greek plays, au example in
which he was followed by other poets, though his own plays,
Cicero says, were not worth reading a second time. We hear also
oi his composing a hymn to Juno to be recited or sung by twenty·
seven virgins in a procession, in consequence of some prodigies
which occurred in niu ; which hymn Livy says was ‘ perhaps com-
mendable at that rude age, but in cur day would be regarded
as irregular and unsuitable ' (27, 37). He died about 203.
