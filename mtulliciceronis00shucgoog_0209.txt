Cicero translator it in Ture. 1, 117:

More mec ne careat lacrimie‚· linquamus amicis
Maerorem, ul celebrenlsmrera cum qemun.

Cicero’s criticism seems tc be the J'ust one-that Solon in
these lines meane merely to express a hope that he may be dear

to his friends and therefore be regretted by thern, the natural 3

thought which Byron cynically rejects in the lines beginning
‘When lime, or soon or late, shall bring‚' etc.

‘No band oi friends or heirs be there
Το weep‚ or wish, the coming blow;
No melden, with dishevelled hair,
Το feel, or feign, deccrcus woe.

‘Bul silent let me sink to earth,
With no officious mcurners nean
Iwould not mar one hour ol mirth,
Nor startle friendship with a tear)

The aspiration of Ennius has no such cynicism in it, bnt con·
veye the proud consciousness oi echievemenls which will secure
hieieme.

9 Νδωό me, etc: this epigram, which Cicero often quotes,
and which he again, in Tmo. 1, 34, contrasts with Solon’e words,
is thus completed :

Acpicc'te, ο cives, sanic Enni imapinlcsormam!
Hic vestrum panxit macima sacta patrum.

Nemo me lacrimis decoret necfuncra fletu
Facit. Ocri Volilo vicos per ora virum.
