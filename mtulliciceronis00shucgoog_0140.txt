esset, Aristides takes the place of one of the accusatives which
would naturally follow 1110 verb 01 naming, salutare.
Aristidis: Aristides, the son 01 Lysimachus, acquired by his
honorabis and trustworthy character the title 01 the lust.
He was one 01 the commandere 01 the Athenian squadron at the
battle of Salamis, and assisted Themistocles in preventing the
Greek fleet from retreating southward and leaving the Persicus

(11.0. 478), when the insolence and treachery 01 the Spartan
Pausanias made them discontented with the Spartan supremacy.
Just before the Persian invasion he had been estracized at the
instigation 01 Themistocles, but 111 their terror 01 the Persians
the Athenians recalled 111111, and he appears to have lived

to a considerable age in high repute, though in poor circum· ι

not possible 1ο 11000 the origin 01 such an idea, which Erasmus
(quoted by G. Long) says was a common one. It may perhaps
be connected with the early preJ'udiee against writing, as harmful
to the faculty 01 memory, from causing it to be less used. Plato
(Phaedr. 274-5) refers tc this, and Caesar (B. G. 6, 14) states
