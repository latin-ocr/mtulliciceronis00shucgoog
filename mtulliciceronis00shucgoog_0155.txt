at the Ticinus, and were defeated. He was again defeated by
Hannibal at the Trebia, where he was forced by his colleague,
against his own judgment, to give Hannibal battle. Meanwhile
he had sent his brother Gnaeus 10 Spain 10 keep up the war
against Hasdrubal. After his consulship his imperium was
prolonged and Spain assigned 10 him as his sphere of work,
(provincia), and to Spain he went early in 217, y'oining his

01 his colleague. In his first consulship he commanded with
his colleague, Μ. Livius Salinator, in an expedition against tho
Illyrians, ior which he was allowed a triumph. The story cf
his death at Cannae, and of his refusal when wounded 10 accept
from a military tribune a horse on which to escape, is told in
Livy, 22, 49: 10 this circumstance Horace alludes in G. 1,12, 31 :
