σῶμα, καὶ τήν ἐμήν ψυχήν καταιδούμενοι ποιεῖτε ἃ ἐγὼ δέομαι· εἶ
δὲ μή οὕτως, ἀλλὰ με’νουσα ή ψυχή ἐν rui σώματι συναποθνήσκει,
ἀλλὰ θεούς γε τοὺς ἀεὶ ὄντας καὶ πάντ’ ἐφορῶντας καὶ πάντα δυνα-
μένους, ot nal τήνδε τήν τῶν ὅλων τάξιν συνέχουσιν ἀτριβῆ καὶ
ἀγήρατον καὶ ἀναμάρτητον καὶ ὑπὸ κάλλους καὶ μεγέθους ἀδιήγη-
τον, τούτους φοβούμενοι μήποτ’ ἀσεβὲς μηδὲν μηδὲ ἆνύσιον μήτε
ποιήσητε μήτε βουλεύσητε.

It will be seen that Cicero omits the passages bracketed·
The first omission, τὰς δὲ κ.τ.λ., passos over another point in
favor of the life oi tho soul after death, viz. the influence the
dead exorciso by hannting and terriiying those who injured

. thamin lile. The second passage omitted, ὁρῶ γὰρ κ.τ.λ., con-
tains an argument somewhat like that in the introduction to
Butler’s Αηιιίορη; viz. that the body in spite of the loss ot
various parts oi itseli remains alive until the final parting oi the
soul, which may therefore be conjectured to be the habitat ol lile.

3 nusquam aut nullum: represent the simpler Greek οὐδέν.
See above, note.

4dum eram: so loap αο. Note imperi. tense with dum
instead oi pres, and see gram. rei.

i si nillum vidibitis: when ηοιι ao longer aee me. For this
use oi nullus = non, see ξ 74.

580. li Neoverb clarorum . . .οοοότδε; by using this epi-
thet Cicero has introduced an argument quite different from
Xenophon's. The latter makes Cyrus argue that our paying
honors to the Manen oi the departed shows that we leel it
necessary to propitiate them, which oould only be so ii we
believed them still able to affect us. This thoroughly Greek
notion (compare the soenes at the tomb oi Agamemnon in
Aeschylus and Sophocles) is modified by Cicero to the argument
that we pay honors to the departed because their former fame
possesses the power of making ns remember them.

11 dum essent: the subJ'. is due to the indirect discourse.

12 vivere . . . emori: adversative asyndeton.

imori: see note, xx. ξ 71.

13 insipientem: Greek ἄφρων, Without intelligente or power
of thought, like dead matter.

15 pt'irus et integer: ἄκρατος καὶ καθαρός, ie. without inter-

, mixture oi gross matter or its delilement.
