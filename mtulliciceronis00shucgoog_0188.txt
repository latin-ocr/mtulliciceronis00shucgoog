ξ 54. 10 Dixi in οδ libro: Oato’s book De lic Rustica or De
Apri Cultura contains many rules ior making and using manure,
as in c. xxviii. where he orders the iarmer to divide his manure
into haIves, one to be used ior the corn land, the other to be
divided between the trees and the meadow land. Again, in
cc. xxxvi-vii. he gives rules ior the particular manure which
is best ior its several uses. In c. lxi he says ‘What is the first
thing in agriculture? Goodploughing. What second? Plough-
ing. What third? Manuring.’

λεῖος), something oi the same sort as the pastinum mentioned
