18 L. Qttinctio Cincinndtb: the story is that in rae. 458, when
the Roman army was in danger trum the Aequians, Cincinnatus
was summoned while engaged in ploughing to become dictator.
He ended the war in sixteen days. Again in 439 he served his
country on a similar call (Livy, 3, 26) ; thus he is said to have
been dictator twice, although Cicero refers to only oue occasion.

1 dictatdrem esse factum: we expect dicere rather than
facere, as the dictator was nominated by the consul, not elected.

2 estius dictatbris idssfi: by whose comvncod when dictator.
The dictator, nominated by a consul on the command of the
Senate, immediately superseded the authority of all other magis-
trates, and his first act was to nominate a magister equitum, to
be second in command to himself.

3 estus Servilius Ahala: Gaius Servilius Structus Ahala,
master of the horse to the dictator Cincinnatus in acces, by
whose order he summoned Spurius Maelius, and on the lattcr's
attempting to escape killed him. (Livy, 4, 14.) According to

’ Cicero (Pro Dom. ξ 86) hc was condemned lor this by a vote ot

was made by a tribune called also Spurius Maelius to prosecute
him, the attempt failed (4, 21). Marcus Brutus, the assassin of
Caesar, claimed to be descended irem Ahala, whom Cicero often
mentiens (especiallyafter Caesar’s murder) with admiration
as the slayer of a tyrant. See Phil. 2, ἕξ 26 and 87.

Sp. Maelium: Spurius Maelius, an eques ot great wealth,
attempted by largesses oi corn to relieve the poor pt Rome, who
were suffering from a famine in me. 440-439, and was accord-
ingly accused by the patricians oi aiming at kingly power.
Cincinnatus was created dictator, and sent his master of the
horse to summon spurius to answer the charge. He sought the
protectior oi his partisans, and appealed to the people; but was
followed and slain by Ahala. This is Livy's story (4, 13-15),
which is the same as that which Cicero knew and olten re-

adpetentem: here causal in force.

4occupatum interemit: carpaced ond tiiied; the notion ι
conveyed by occupatum is that ot his being taken off his guard, '
when engaged in his attempt. According to Livy (4,14) Ahala
killed Maelius in the midst of an appeal to a crowd among whom
