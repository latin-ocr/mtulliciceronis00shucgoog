§m l.6 Tarentum: the recovory oi Tarentum in mc. 209
by Fabius in his fifth consulship was oi great importance to the
Romans, as it recalled the Samnites and Lucanians to their

to be some confusion about his name. Polybius calls him Gaias
Livius, Livy always Marcus Motus, without any coyaomca; but
in 27, 34, 7 he speaks oi a Marcus Livius Maeotae, as the
Roman commender who held the citadel oi Tarentum when
