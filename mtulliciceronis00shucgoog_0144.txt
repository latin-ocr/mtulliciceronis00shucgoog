had committed these horrible deeds, he blinded himself. He is
here mentioned as the subject of a play of Sophocles The
name means ‘Swell-ioot‚’ irom the thongs with which his iniant
feet were pierced or tied tightly when he was exposed.

2 liberatus: he was aequitted.

523. l. 3 There now follows a list oi Greek poets and philoso-
phers who were intellectually active even at an advanced age.

Hesiodum: Hesiod, a native of, Ascra in Boeotia. We have
three works which pass under his name, Tbe Worlcs aad Days,
a poem on Agriculture, which Vergil regarded as his model ior
the Georpies; the Tbeopoaia, a poem on the parentage oi the
Gods and the origin oi the Universe; and the Sbielol of Hercules,
a poem on the contest between Hercules and Ares. The gen-
uineness oi these poems, the question as to identity oi author-
ship, and the period of Hesiod's own existence, have been the
subjecte of endless controversies.

4 Simonidem: Simonides, son oi Ieoprepes, born at Iulis in
the island oi Ceos—thus called Κεῖος as distinguished from the
elder poet simonides ot Amorgos—b. aa. 556, ob. 469. He
was intimate with Pausanias and Themistocles, and the Sicilian
tyrants Theron and Hieron. His chief works, some ot which
are extant, were Epieikia, ie. songs celebrating victorias
in the games, hymns, dithyrambs‚ threni or laments, and
sepulchral inscriptions. Perhaps the most famous oi the last
was his epitaph for the Spartans who fell at Thermopylae [Her.
l, 2283 Diod. Sic. 11, 3],

ὦ ξεῖν’, ἀγγέλλειν haeseramus ὅτι τῇδε
κείμεθα τοῖς κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι,

which Cicero (Tuae. 1,101) translated thus:

Die, hospes, Spartae uos te bic vidisse iacentes,
Dum sanctis patriae lapibus obsequimur,

the last line being probably taken from the Greek as given in

D¹⁰d⁰r¹¹⁸’ κείμεθα τοῖς κείνων πειθόμενοι νομίμοις·

He died at Syracuse, where he was staying at the court oi

Hieron. Alamous story of how his lile was saved by the

Tyndaridae, who summoned him from the house oi Scopas

which immediately afterwards iell down, is told by Cicero in
rr
