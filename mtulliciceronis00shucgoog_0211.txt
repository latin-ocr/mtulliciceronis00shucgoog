Tarquinii, who ¹had invaded the Roman territory in order to
reinstate the Tarquins. (Livy, 1, dii-2, 6.) The story is full
of difficulties, as ara all old storias before tha age of written
recorde (and often after that age as well). But it seems to be

acknowledged that there was such a person as Brutus, and that 1

he was magister coleram, or commender of the horse. Cicero
constantly refers to him, because of his services to libertas, and
M. Brutus as well as Decimus, who helped to assassinate Caesar,
claimed to be his descendant.

and 256. The story here referred to is that of his voluntary
return 10 Carthage and his death there with tortura. The ear·
liest authority for these particulare is Cicero himself. (Dc Off.

back of the Second Punic War (De ch. 1,1, 1). His services
were for the most part in Sicily, wherea festival to his honor
was long kept up in Syracuse called Μαρκελλεῖα (Vera 2, 51).
In his second consulship, to which he was elected after the fall
of one of the consuls at Cannae, he obtained some success against
Hannibal at Nola. In his third consulship he was sent 10 Sicily,
where he remaincd between two and three years, and took Leon·

genius. On returning to Rome he was refused a regular triumph
on the technical ground that his having handed his army over
