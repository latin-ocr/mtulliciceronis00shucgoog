At the comitiaci 185, Cato was elected to the
censorship along with his former oolleague, L.
Valerius Flaccus.¹ He now had an opportunity of

{g} showing by practical measures what he thought was
necessary as a cure for the state of things he had so
often denounced. The office was one of great dig-
nity, was held for eighteen months instead of the
twelve to which the other curule magistrates were
limites, and enabled its holders to make themselves
felt in the city in a variety ol ways, not only in the ’
matter of public morals, but as regards the public
comfort, so far as it depended upon the serviceable
condition of some of the most necessary public
structures. Thus Cato lined the reservoirs of
water with flagstones and cut off the pipes of water
which had been illegally laid to private houses from =
the public supply3 cleaned out the old cloccae, and
constructed new ones in the plebeian quarter of the y
city, the Aventine3 secured certain open spaces lor ¹
the public use, and forced those who had built their
’ houses into the street to pull down their encroach- ,
ments within thirty days, and built a basilica
(the Porcia) and certain shops. But it was in the
discharge of the other functions of a censor that
cato, firmly supported by his colleaguc, made his t

greatest reputation. His chief dutics were to revise
