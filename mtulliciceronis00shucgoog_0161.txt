Spain, contributed much 10 the defeat and death 01 Publius
Scipio (212, Liv. 25, 34). He appears to have remained in
Spain until 205, when, becoming convinced that success was
destined to the Roman arms, ho made a secret compact with tho
Roman commandens, and led his troops back 10 Africa (Liv. 28,
10). On the death of the father and uncle of Masinissa, who had
held the royal power iu succession, Mezetulus, a distant kins-
man, soizod the throne and allied himself with Carthago, and also
with Syphax. Masinissa keepiug on the side 01 Reme conquered
, both, and held his father’s kingdom (204). He afterwards
aided Laelius in conquering and taking prisoner his rival Syphax
208). Masinissa afterwards was by tho gratitudo 01 1110 Ro
mans rewarded with large additions to his kingdom (201), aud
from this time forward he was a faithful ally 01 Rome.
The last we hear of him in Livy is in tho year 168, when 110

all that he could 101 their warin tho East. He died twenty
years later, in 148, when the younger Africanus was in Africa
carrying on tho Third Punic War (Appian, Pan. 105), leaving
it a strict charge with his sons 10 submit the arrangement 01

21 capite operte: Abl. 01 characteristic, ‘to be with covered

and before Cicero's tirno wore nothing on the head; but on
journeys and in bad westher had a kind 01 hood (00001101) 01
hat ( pileus or petasus). As lato as tho time of Augustus we find
it mentioned as something noticeable that the Emperor never
went out winton 01 summer without a hat (non-nist petasatus,
Suet. 82). Slaves especially wore always uncovered, hence
pileos redimire = ‘to purchase troadem!
