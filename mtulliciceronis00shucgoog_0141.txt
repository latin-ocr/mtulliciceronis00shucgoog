popular talk is not uncommon. Inscriptions on tombstones
would be probably the earliest form of writing known to the
vulgar. We might compare it with the popular idea that to
meet a woli caused dumbness, sec Verg. Eci. ix. 54; Theocr. 14,
152. Cicero seems to allude to some similar proverb in De Fin.
5, §3, ueteris proverbi admonitu uteorum memini. Otto,
apricatione· der Ro'mer, p. 218, believes that these words have
no reference to a proverb, but to a superstitious idea that
reading the monuments of the past leads one to disregard the ·
present.

quod munt: as the carrina poem· ci. ut dicitur, § 49.

6 in memoriam redet mortuorum: Ι pet a tina of second
memoras, that narnely os the dead. So far from losing memory
by reading sepulchral inscriptions, I refresh it. 'sne expression
is a curicus inversion of the commoner ‘recall to memory'; it

⁶ speaks oi memory as something outside oneseli to which one

returns. Long quotes Verr. 2, 46, redite in memoriam, iudices,
quae trtius libido in dicendosuerit. cf. Ter. Phorm. 802.

‘inec verti: introducing a general conclusion, nor in point
ossact.

8 senem: here equal to cum aenea esset, because be was an
old man.

uersuum (ie, τίθημι) : aburied treasure, ubere be had bid
tiemonem

9 quae cflrant: ibe things that interest them.

vadimonia consuitur: appointmente at court. The regular
phrase is uadimonium promittere. Constituere is used as appli-
oablc to both plaintiff and defendant. (Reid.) The plural vadi·
monta is employed as usual when speaking generally and not of
a particular case. Vadimonium is properly the engagement
entered into by a defendant in a civil suit, after the preliminary
hearing oi the ease, to appear ona fixed day to answer to the
action. As security for this appearance he either pald a sum ol
money into court or brought forward securities (vades) ior his
appearance. This ‘appointment’ was called vadianonium, and
henee there are numerous phrases which mean to keep or break
it, eg. u. sistere, o. obire, ad v. venire, v. deserere, ad v. non
uenire. lt was the necessity oi the bore's appearing to answer to
his bail that relieved Horace from his tormentor on the Via
Sacra (Sat. i. 9, 36-75).
