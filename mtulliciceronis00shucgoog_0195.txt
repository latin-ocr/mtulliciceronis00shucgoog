and in 401 started for Babylon to seize the Persian throne. He

met his brother at Qunaxa 011 the Euphrates and fell in battle. ,

The Greek mercenarios who had really been the actors in the
battle escaped under the command of Xenophon to the shore
of the Black Sea at Trapezus, whence they returned to Greece.
Xenophon, in Anabucis, 1, 9, describes Cyrus as a man of
extraordinary talent and industry even from boyhood. γ

17 Lysander: a Spartan who was navarchus in a.c.404, when l
he destroyed the Athenian lieet at Aegospotami. He was the
son of Aristodicus, a man of good family but of small means.
He did not become conspicuous until the second half of the Pelo-
ponnesian War, ie. after 415; but his movements after that
time about the coast of Asia, his friendship with Cyrus, and the
respect which his vigor and honesty inspired among the allies,
contributed much to the fall of Athens. After Aegospotami he
sailed leisurely to Athens and blockaded the Piraeeus. ln a
few months he reduced it to surrender, and compelled the citi-
zens to allow the long walls to be pulled down. lt was under
his influence that the Thirty Tyrants were set up in Athens, and
if he had not been thwarted by the Spartan king he would in all
probability have defeated the patriotic party in the Piraeeus,
who underThrasybulus drove the Thirty out. He fell in battle at
Haliartos fighting against the Thebans, in 395. Xen. Hell. 2,2
and 3, 15, 16. See Plutarch's Life of Lysander.

l eomm'unem atque humanum: affoblc cred polite, Cicero’s
paraphrase ol φιλοφρονεῖσθαι. Oonctaunem has been corrected
to comem in some Mss. and editions. But communem conveys
better the idea of a superior putting himself on a level with an
inferior, cf. Laelius de Ant. §653 and the confusion between
the two words is naturally frequent in abbreviated writing.
See for an instance Ter. Hecat. 412.

aquendam cdnsaeptum agrum diligenter censitum: a
paraphrase ol the one Greek word παράδεισον, which Xenophon
introduced from the East to describe the parks and pleasure
grounds of Asia.
