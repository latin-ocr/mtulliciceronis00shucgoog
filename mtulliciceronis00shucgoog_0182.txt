Publius cornelius scipio Nasica corculum: was the son 01
Ρ. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, who in mc. 203 was charged by the
Senate as optimus cir to receive the Magna Mater, and grandson
01 Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio, who fell in Spain. He was consul
in 172, but resigned because there had been a flaw in the
auspices. He was censor in 159, and in his second consul·
ship, 155, served suocesstully against the Illyrians. From
the text we learn that he was elected pontifex mon. in 150.
His great knowledge 01 jurisprudence gained him the dis-
tinguishing oopnonten oi Corculum (the cor being regarded as
the seat 01 1111011001). He was besides an eloquent speaker
(Brut. §79).

primus est M. Cornelius Oetbepus, cuius eloquentiae est auctor ct
idoneis quidem meo sententia Q. Bruuius praesertim curn et ipse
curn audiverit ot scribut de mortuo. He was elected to the 001-
lega 01 Pontiils in 213, and was praetor in 211. Etruria was
assigned to him in his consulship, where he prevented uprisings
in lavor 01 Carthago by territying the Etruscan nobles into flight.
The year aiter his consulship (203) he served as proconsul in
the territory 01 the Insubrian Gauls, near Milan, where he met
and defeated Hannibal’s brother Mago (Livy, 30, 18). Cethegus
died in 196. Ηο is classed by Horace with Cato as affording
a standard ior the Latinity 01 that epoch. (Ep. 2, 2, 117 ; Α. P. 50.)
