21 Statius noster: Gaius Caecilius Statius was an Insubrian
Gaul, probably brought like Terence as a captive in war to
Rome. Like Terence too, being manumitted‚ he adopted a
name probably irem his master who set him free. According
to Gellius (4, 20) his servile name was Statius, which he retained
as a copnomen,· just as Terence, being an African captive and
being set free hy Publius Terentius Lucanus, thenceiorth was
called Publius Terentius Afer, i.e. he adopted the nomen and
praenomen oi his patronos, and retained his slave designation
as his capnomen. Some oi the ancient critice thought Caecilius
the best of the Roman comio writers (Aul. Gell. 15, 24, Sueten.
Vit. Ter. 11). Cicero, in the treatise De Opt. Gen. Or. ξ 2, says
that he was ‘perhaps the best comic writer,' but in a letter to
Atticus (l, 3, 10) observes that he was but a poor authority
in regard to Latinity. The year oi his death is not certain.
Caecilius wrote fabulae palliatae, ie. plays from the Greek, like
Plautus, Terence and others. Numerous fragments oi his plays
survive, and may be read in Ribbeck's Frapmenta, pp. 29-69.

Synephebis: ‘The comrades’ or ‘Fellow-Youths,’ the title
of a play oi Caecilius Statius, based upon Menander's Συνέφηβοι,
referred to in De Fin. 1, 2, 4 as an excellent specimen oi Latin
comedy. Menander (nc. 342-291), from whom Statius horrowed,
was the chief poet oi the New Comedy.
