on a mission to Pyrrhus ior exchange oi prisoners3 where tha
King vainly sought ιο corrupt him with brihes or terriiy him
with the sight oi his elephanta. In 279 he was a leaaaa
sarving iu the army which Pyrrhus defeated at such a ruinous
eost at Asculum3 and next year (278), being consul, he sub-

Roman, living on the cultivation oi his iarm when not engaged
in the service oi the stata. His action, in sending back ιο ι
Pyrrhus the traitor who had offered to poison the King, is often
quoted as a signal instance oi Roman honour. -1 Manius Uarius
