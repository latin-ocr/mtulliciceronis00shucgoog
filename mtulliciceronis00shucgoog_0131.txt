0000 (116, 8) does it and in the fragments 01 cicero’s own
poems it oecurs; but the new school 01 poete (aovi poetae),
he says, avoided it. Or. 161. (See also Wordsworth, Fragments
of Early Latia, p. 583.) The question remeius as to whether
the e was or was not leit out in writing. Cicero says ito enim
loquebamur, ete, and the phrase admits 01 the interpretation
that though the e was dropped in pronunciation it was retained
in writing. In Lucretius ‘the Mss. all with one doubtful excep-
tion write the s’ (Munro). But Ithink the testimony 01 inscrip-
tiens is more in favour 01 dropping than 01 retaining it. (See
Lindsay, Latin Lanpuupe, p. 123.)
