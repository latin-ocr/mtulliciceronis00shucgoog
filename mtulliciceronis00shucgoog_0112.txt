’ §L Mite, etc: Cicero applies to litus Pomponius Atticus,

his intimate friend, lines from the tenth book 01 the Annales
01 Ennius, in which a shepherd, who, in the war with Philip 01
Macedon, guided the Romans under ¹Titus Quinctius Flamininus
to the heights commanding the Macedonian army, is represented
as addressing the Reman general. (Livy, 32, a, 10.)

Ennius: was born at Rudiae in Calabria rac. 239 and died
169. His chief work was an epic poem in Latin hexameters
called Annales, a history 01 Rome from the time 01 Aeneas
down to his own age.

flamininus: Titus Quinctius Flamininus was consul in nc.
198 and afterwards obtained Macedonia as his provincia, where
in the spring 01 1117 he fought the battle 01 Cynoscephalae and
defeated Philip 01 Macedon. His great work was the estab-
lishment 01 Roman power in Greece. In 183 he served as
ambassador to Prusias, king 01 Bithynia, in regard to Hannibal,
who thereupon through sear 01 the Romans poisoned himself.

Titus Pomponius, surnamed Atticus from his residence in
Athens, was born in rac. 109. He was wealthy, fond 01 learning,
and content, though constantly associating with men prominent
ln political liie, to live without attaining official position. Our
information in regard to him is mainly derived from the letters
which he received from Cicero and preserved. We have also a
biography by Cornelius Nepos. Cicero, in letters to Atticus
(cl. 16, 11, 3), speaks 01 this treatise under the title ‘O Tarax
a Roman custom 01 using the initial words as a title, as, in the
case 01 the Aeneid, Anna utramque.
