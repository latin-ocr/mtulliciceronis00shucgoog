oppressive measures in Sicily, and appears to have
so iar gained a hearing that commissionem were
sent into Sicily to make enquiries. But Scipio's
brilliant successes in Africa, for a time at least,

η silenced all tongues; and the news oi the battle ⁹
of Zama (202) made him the greatest man in
Rome. And though we have no account oi Cato’s
reconciliation with the Scipios‚ yet the marriage
of his son at a later time with the sister of the
younger Africanus seems to point to it.1

Cato's rugged simplicity‚ ¹upon which his experi-

ence in the Greek cities of Sicily had had no
effect, joined to his manifest oratorioal ability, ⁸
secured the favor of the people‚ and at the end oi Ι
200 he was elected one of the plebeian aediles, fyg·
whose duties were connected principally with the
public buildings and baths used by the lower
orders.

1 Plutarch seems to ignore his going to Africa, and says that
he returned irom Sicily and attached the extravagance oi Scipio
θ (Oai. §3); but see Livy, 29, 25.
