Silbea, 2d ed. 1889, being followed in the measure-
ment of hidden quantities. For the convenience of
toachers and studento, the grammatica] references to
Allen and Greenough,Gildersleeve-Lodge,andHark-
ness have been placed at the bottom of each page.

The notes have been entirely rewritten, much
attention being given to the Latinity, a matter
which should be presented to the student early in
his college career, if not in his preparatory work.
Much assistance has been obtained in this respect
from Dr. Reid's most valuable edition. The edi-
tions of Meissner and Sommerbrodt and the recent
American work by Professor Rookwood have been
of much service.

The extensive Biographical Index in the original
edition has been omitted, as unsuited to the charac-
ter of the present work, and an index of proper
names has been substituted Much matter has been
taken from the index and inserted in the notes,
where it will be more likely to reach the eye of
the ordinary American student.

My thanks are due to my colleague, Dr. Nelson =

Glenn MoCrea, for his valuable suggestions and
for his assistance in proofreading.
