The saturnina Κονίου) says: “Tho hook is a good one. ¹'I'he exer·
olses are plentiinl‚ and the words which they contain are such as will bs
uaeiul to learners when they pass on to higher work.”

Tho mrerary werza says: “ The young learner who cannot ‘get on
with’ his Latin under so simple and gontly-progresslve a course aa Mr.
Ooolr has here laid down, had better be allowed no give it up altogether.
Tha teaoher’s work has been greatly simplified and lessened by the
omission of any advanoed rules or complex examples. . . . The hook
seems to ua admirably suited for glrls' schools as well as' tor boys’‚ and
it ia marvellously well printed and got np for the prloe charged.”

Tho Glatsgow Herald says: “This manual ia admirably adopted to
the Latin requirements ot the Sootoh Ooda for the first year. All the
ground is covered, and the exerelaes ior translation from and lnto Latin
ara numerous and jndioionsly arranged. The plan oi the book ia ono
by which the pupll is made to take stook of his knowledge at every step,
and security is thus got for the foundation inLatin grammar being soundly
laid. 'l'he boolr is likely to become a favorite. . . . The hook is admir-
ably simple and pr·aotioal.”
