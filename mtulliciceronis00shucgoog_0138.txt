Oi these one well-known line is preserved,

to which Metellus answered,

et Naevio poetae eum saepe laederentur,
dabunt melum Metelli, debeat melum Metelli.

he was thrown into prison. When released hythe interposition
oi a tribune, he retired to Utica, where he died in 2033 though
Cicero (Brut. §50) says that Varro thought that he lived longer.

than the work oi Ennius.
