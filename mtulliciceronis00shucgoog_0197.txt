150 cnud aaron.

22 esset = uiueret.

aeta iam astate: abl. absolute.

24 quantum spatium . . noluerunt: at the age of sorry-six
a Roman was free from the obligation tc military service, which
began at seventeen. A man's age, therefore, was thus divided:

1-17 puer, 17-30 adulescens (30 was the quaestorias ape),
30-45 iuvenis, 45-60 senior, 60- senex.

25 senectutis initium: the uetus seniorum. Senectus is thus
used in the general sense from forty-five years, while speaking
exactly it began at sixty. See above and note, ξ 4.

1 cursus bonerum: the penca dureuy which he bold official
positione. Marcus Valerius Corvus was consul for the first time
in rac. 348, and for the sixth time in 299. But fn the latter
year he was in office for part of the year only, being consul
suffectus on the death of T. Manlius Torquatus. But if we take
his last (or fifth) complete consulship in 300, Cicerc’s calcula-
tion will be exactly right. The cursus bonorum here applies
simply tc the consulship. It regularly denotes the official career,
ie. the quaestcrship, aedileship or tribunatu of the plebs, prae·
torship, consulship. It had its widest· applicaticn in the empire
when it referred not only to the cffices of the senatorial order,
butte those of the equestrian order and those open to the plebs
or lower class as well.

atque huius . . . minus: the lust part os bis life uus happler
than the middle, because be hedmere iuflucnce uad less labor:
meaning, I suppose, that his last two consulships, when he was
more than eighty-five, must have been more honorary than
active.

3 apex: properly the twig bound with wool set fn the cap of
the flamines and sulii. Here figuratively for the chief placy.

561. l.5 A. arnis Galatinb: Aulus Atilius Calatinus was
consul in nc. 258 and 254, and dictator 249, censor 247. His
cognomen means an inhabitant of Calatia in Campania. In
his first consulship he fought against the Carthaginians in
Sicily with some success. In his second consulship he captured
Panormus. Cicero (De uep.1,1‚1) classes him with Duellius
and Lucius Metellus as having freed Rome from the terror cf
Carthage.

quanta: atteteritur.
