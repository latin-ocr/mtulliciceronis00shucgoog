The four charyes esseest old aye are: Ι. It removes ussrom
active business, 11. It wealeens our bodies, 111. Ie deprives
us ospleasures IV. Ie is close to death, We will consider
these separacely.

15. Etenim, eum complector animo, quattuor re-

* peris) causes cflr seneetfis misera videatur: sinam,
quod avocet¹ {erebus gerendis3 alteram, quod eorpus
faeiat infirmius3 tertiam, quod privet fere omnibus
voluptatibus3 quartam, quod haud procul absit a 5
mosee. Earum, si placet, causarum quanta quamque
sit insta sena quaeque, videamus.

Ι, old age removes us from active business.

From some decies, nos all. Some belone especially co old

not νοω. Bodily eiqor is noteverythe'w, esperienee and
wisdom eoum too. I cannot now serve e‘es the field, but am
as sacal to Oarssaee es ifI did. Old men in Sparta held
the hiqhest authority and eave a name co the Senate. The
cantion os aye is osten better than the boldness os youth.
