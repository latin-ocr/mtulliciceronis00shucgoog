24 sodalitates: clais. The meaning is, new societies, were
formed at this time, not that the custom was uow first introduced.
These sodalitates seem to have been at first wholly social, and,
as we· see here, 10 have originated 111 a plan oi celebrating a
national festival by a meeting oi friends at dinner. However, the
tie between the members was close, ior Cicero classes officia tute-
lae, sodalitatis, familiaritatis together 1 Varr. 2, 1, 47, 594) 3and
sometimes it was carried into politice. Sodalitiam therefore
became the term ior the crime oi wholesale bribery (Pro Plaac.
15, 36 and 19, 41), and in 55 ac. a decreeoi the Senate was iouud
necessary 10 order the olubs to disperse under penalty 01 tho
members’ being prosecuted dc ai (ad Q. Fr. 2, 3, 5). Gn.
Plancius was charged with sodalitium, under the Lea Licinia
(passed ac. 70) and Cicero’s speech in his deience is extant.
They, however, continued to exist as social nnions, ior Ovid
says that he and Propertius were members oi the same club
(Tr. 4‚10,4o) 3 butas popular electioris ceased under the Empire,
they lost all political significance. (Mommsen, H. af R, 1014,

An embassy was sent to King Attalus oi Pergamus, and he pre·
sented the commissioners with a blach stone which was believed
to be the goddess. (See Lanciani, Ancieat Rome p. 126.) When
it came 10 Rome it was received by P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica
as ‘tho best man,' -in accordante with the order oi the oracla.
