belonged to Manius Curius who had celebrated three triumphs.
He often walked to this cottage and contemplated the smallness

three triumphs, used to dig this little farm with his own hand

and live in this cottage. And how that it was there that, as he ³

answered ‘⁴ that a man who could he content with such a dinner

wanted no gold; and that he thought it a more honorable thing l
to conquer those who had gold.’' Cato considering these things ¹

used to return and look over his own farm, his servants, and

house, add to his labor and economize in all unnecessary ¹

expenditures.'
