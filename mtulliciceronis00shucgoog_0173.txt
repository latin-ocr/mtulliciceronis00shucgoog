15 (1) Publius Decius Mus the elder, is the hero of the Sam·
nite War oi rac. 342-340. We hear oi his rescuing the consul
Cornelius and his army from a position oi peril near Saticula,
and receiving ior that service a crown from the consul and
another from the soldiers (corone obsidionalis, Liv. l, 37). In
340 he was consul, and had to serve in a war with the
Latini. Livy tells how at Capua both ho and his colleaguo
dreamed the same dream: that a man oi superhuman size and
dignity appeared, and warned thern that on one side the leader,
on the other the armyitseli, must perish. In the battle oi Veseris
near Mt. Vesuvius, he thereupon ‘devoted ' himself ‘to the Manes
and to Earth,' and mounting his horserode into the midst oi the
enemy and was killed (Liv. 8, 9). Cicero (Tuae. 1, 37, 89) says
that a third Decius, son oi this last, acted in the same way in
the war with Pyrrhus, at the battle oi Asculum, rae. 279.

15 Ρ. nscio: Publius Decius Mus, the younger, was consul
in rac. 312, 308, 297, 295, and censor in 304. He served with
success against the Samnites, both as consul and aiter his year
oi office as proconsul. In his last consulship he had with his
colleaguo Fabius to serve against the Etruscans, who were
assisted by the Galli Senones. In the battle oi Sentinum,
295, the Roman ranks were breaking and in disorder. Decius,

aiter vainly attempting to rally them, devoted himself like his 1

father (familiare setam, Liv. 10, 28), to the ‘Earth and Manes,'
and having donc so rushed into the thickest part oi the foe and
perished.
