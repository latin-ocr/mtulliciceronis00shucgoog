9 Nestor: King oi Pylos, represented by Homer, as in the
text, to have lived to three times the ordinary age of man. He
is the counsellor and referee in all difficulties and dangers in
the war, and it is he that, with odysseus, is sent to try to draw
Achilles from his sullen retirement. Cicero quotes him as an
instance of the respect which years bring, and that is J'ust the
characteristic brought iorward in the Iliad.

tertiam.. .viribus: Iliad, 1, 247 sq.

11 vera praedicans: is desperatissimam note conditional
force of participle.

distein Ajax, son oi Telamon, King oi Salamis, one oi the
Homeric heroes who went on the expedition against Troy. Aiter
the death oi Achilles he was a competitor ior the arms oi that
hero and being worsted by Odysseus went mad, and imagining
he was slaying his rivale, killed a number oi beasts. When his
madness subsided, and he had found what he had done, he slew
himself. In the Iliad he is represented as a great warrior next
111 prowess to Achilles. Cicero here refers to him as an example
oi brute strength opposed to the wisdom 01 Nestor.

8 miles . . . aum tribt'inus militaris: Cato here mentions
the various stages of his active life. He was a private soldier
(miles) in the Hannibalian War (ξ 10) ; he was quaestor in Sicily
in 204; as consul 195 he conducted a campaign with harshness
though with vigor in Spain3 and in 191 he served in the war
against Antiochus as tribanus militam. Livy (36, 11) calls
Cato comulart's legatus, ie. a man 01 consular rank serving in
a commender-inobief's staff. And this doubtless truly describes
his position; but would not prevent his serving as tribunus nor
in any other position assigned him by the consul or proconsul.
