The curiosity of flaccus was roused. He asked
his neighbor to dinner, perceived the sterling '
worth and energy of his character and, believing
that he had found a man able and willing to cope
with the growing corruption and effeminacy of

Roman life, persuaded him to come to Rome and ¹

take his chance with other rising citizens in civil
life.l

This young man was Marcus Porcius Cato His ,

family—belonging to the plebeian gens Porcia—-

had formerly been distinguished by the cognomen ,

of Priscus, but the reputaticn of his father or
grandfather among his neighbors for good sense
(says Plutarch) had caused them to receive the

name of Oete, formed from the word cetus,
‘shrewd.'² Both the father and grandfather had
served as soldiers, but neither had held office, and
Marcus was therefore a cocus homo when he came
to Rome. Still, as ⁴Tusculum was a munimntum
cum suffragiu, he was a full¹ citizen, and, if he
resided at Rome and showed himself in the forum
as taking part in public business, had as good a
chance of being elected to office as another.³

The date of his birth is variously given (no. 234-
