GENERAL IN TRODUOTION· XV

His introduction here as a speaker followed natu·
rally from that of Scipio Their friendship was
famous, and where Scipio was, there Laelius was
likely to be, Cicero has celebrated their intimacy
in his Laelius dc Amicitia. Laelius was a bravc ,
and skilful soldier, being second in command at the Ι
capture of Carthago He held also the civil offices

· of tribune, praetor, and finally consul, the last, in.
140. Laelius also represented, even more than
Scipi0, the learning and culture of the day. His
coyuomea, Sapiens, he acquircd, as others had done,
from his deep knowledge of jurisprudence; and as
a politician, though not so eminent, hc was, like
Scipio, in opposition to the extreme party which
was headcd by the Gracchi.

(3) cato. - In the last quarter of the third
cenmry ac. one of the best and most upright of
the patricians, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, had a
country house near Tusculum. While staying
there, he was often told by his slaves about the'
owner of a small estate in his neighborhood. This
young man had acquired a great reputation among
his neighbcrs for the vigor and industry with
which he cultivated his farm, for the 'rugged hon-
esty of his character, ior the raciness of his wit and
the homely wisdom ol his conversation, as well as
by his power of cloquencc displayed in local courts,

and his rigid fairncss when acting as arbitrator. j
