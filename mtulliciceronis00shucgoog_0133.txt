Dentatus, consul in u.c.290, 275, and'214. lu his first consulship
he obtained a triumph for victories over the Samnites aud
Sabines; iu his third he conquered Pyrrhus at the battle oi
Beneventum, ior which he seems to have celebrated another
triumph (Pro Mur. ξ 31). He is oiten mentioned by Cicero as
a friend oi Coruncanius and Fabricius, and by Horace in con-
junction with Fabricius as a type oi the old-iashioned trugal
Roman—incomptis Curiam capillis, C. 1, 12, 41. Alter his
victory over Pyrrhus he·returned to his iarm and lived a retired
life, though he was censor in 272. His saying that he ‘pre-
ferred ruling over the wealthy to possessing wealth himself'
is often quotcd; ci. ξ 55. — Tiberius Coruncanius, a jurist, was
consul in 280. His chief fame rests on his proiound knowledge

oi law, which he publicly taught, and ior his skill in which he ⁸

received like other jurists the title oi Sapiens. In 254 he was
created pontifex monimus, and died a few years afterwards.
He is oiten referred to by Cicero as an authority on jurisprudence,
eg. De Or. 3, 33.

cognomen from the iact oi his being blind, was consul rao. 307

of these was the oia Appia leading from Rome to Capua, aiter·
wards extended to Brundisium. The second was the opero
Appia, the first aqueduct constructed to supply Rome with
water. Appius retained his censorship beyond the eighteon
months named by the lea Aemilia, and until he was elected
consul, so that being in a high office ior five contiuuous years
lie was able tocomplete the public works he had planned. In his
second consulship he iought against the Etruscans, and in
295 as praetor against the Samnites and Etruscans, but with
ludifierent success. When Pyrrhus, aiter defeatiug Laevinus
ln 280 at Heraclea, sent proposals to Rome ior peace, Appius
caused himself to be carried into the senate-house and spoke so
eloquentlyagaiustit that be prevented the Senate irom accepting
the offer. (Livy, Ep. xiia) The speech was extant in Cicero’s
time (Brut. 6, 61), as is stated in the text. Cicero says iu his
Tusculan Disputations, 5, 38, 112, that the misiortune oi Appius
